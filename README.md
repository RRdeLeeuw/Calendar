# Calendar

This repository contains a very, very, simple JavaScript rendered calendar. 

## About me

Programming/Web-development is a hobby of mine. I follow free online courses and try to learn new things as much I can. 

## Luxon disclaimer

This calendar makes use of the Luxon library! This library is required for it to work. 
The Luxon library information, installation guide and creator information can be found here:
