# Calendar

This repository contains a very, very, simple JavaScript rendered calendar. It is nothing more than me experimenting and learning about JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

## About me

Programming/Web-development is a hobby of mine. I follow free online courses and try to learn new things as much I can. But I am in all means an amateur. Please keep in mind I am a beginner, if you have tips, tricks or constructive criticism please feel free to reach out. 

## Luxon disclaimer

This calendar makes use of the Luxon library! This library is required for it to work. 
The Luxon library information, installation guide and creator information can be found here:
